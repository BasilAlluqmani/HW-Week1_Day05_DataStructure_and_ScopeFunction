# Kotlin Essentials (Data Structure /Scope Functions)
---
The Kotlin assignment has three components
- Practice with Scope Functions.
- Practice with Lists and Sets.
- Practice with Maps.

> Note: You must save your solution as `solution_part1.kt` for Part I, `solution_part2.kt` for Part II, and `solution_part3.kt` for Part III.

## Part I - with Scope Functions.
---
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Let'
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Run'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Also'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)

## Part II - Practice with Lists and Sets.
---
- Create a list and access it and print it, then update or add elements to it
- Create a list and access out of its bounds, then manage the array errors safety with 3 different ways
- Create a list then add repetitive and unique elements to it, then convert it to set, then add new elements to it and print the set values

## Part III - Practice with Maps.
---
##- Write an asnwer to this question: What are the cases that I need to use the map for??


map is a collection which contains pairs of objects. Map holds the data in the form of pairs which consists of a key and a value. Map keys are unique and the map holds only one value for each key. Kotlin distinguishes between immutable and mutable maps

case for use map :

if data consists of a key and a value.

if  return a set of all key/value pairs in the map Using keys properties.

if useing pairs of objects



##- What is the difference between immutable and read only variables?


An immutable object is one that cannot be changed, once created.
read only is set on the reference to an object. Immutability is a property of the object itself

var is used for setter (value will change).

val is used for getter (read-only, value won't change)

##- Create a map of 20 elements of strings and doubles
